# Slack-age-bot
This is a slack bot that caculates the age of user when the user inputs their year of birth

## Requirements:
To launch and run this bot, you need:
1. a slack workspace in which you are admin
2. slack api keys and tokens
3. Go installed

# Installation
1. **Step 1 (slack website)**
*  go to the [slack api website](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and create a new app. Ensure you select the app from scratch as it will allow you to manually get configurations.
*  Enable [socket mode](https://app.slack.com/app-settings/T054RSZRBS6/A054UC5UTT6/socket-mode). this will generate the app bot token that will allow you to connect to the bot. 
* Enable [events](https://api.slack.com/apps/A054UC5UTT6/event-subscriptions). This will ensure your app is notified of events on slack. For this particular bot, ensure you subscribe to the following events:
```
\app_mention
\im_history_changed
\message.channels
\message.im
\message.mpim
```
* [navigate the OAuth and permissions](https://api.slack.com/apps/A054UC5UTT6/oauth?). This section will provide you with the slack application token and also give you the opportunitity to define permissions for your bot.

For this particular bot, ensure you give the following permissions: 
```bash 
\app_mentions:read
\calls:read
\calls:write
\channels:history
\channels:manage
\channels:read
\chat:write
\chat:write.public
\im:history
\im:read
\im:write
\mpim:history
\mpim:read
\mpim:write

```
